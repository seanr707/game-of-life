Rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 
Code was originally written on codepen.io, therefore it does not include the packages to compile the SASS or Babel and the files are not split up.

A future revision may be made to reformat the code to utilize Webpack and ES6 Modules.
